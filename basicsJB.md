# Git Basics

* 'git init' - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* 'git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status for 
the repo
* 'git commit' - pushes all of the staged changes to the master branch
* 'git diff' - showd differences between versions, can be used across 
different levels (e.g. untracked and staged)
* 'git log' - records history of changes made in the repository
